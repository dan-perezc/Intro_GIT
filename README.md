## üöÄ Instructions for Students

### üì¶ Step 1: Accept the Invitation
Your instructor will add you as a collaborator on the GitHub repository. Check your email or GitHub notifications to accept the invite.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Step 2: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
GitHub no longer allows password authentication for Git operations. You‚Äôll need a Personal Access Token to push your changes.

1. Go to: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token ‚Üí Fine-grained token"**
3. Under **Repository access**, choose:
   - `Only select repositories`
   - Select the repo your instructor invited you to (e.g., `Intro_GIT_bootcamp_year`)
4. Under **Permissions**:
   - `Contents` ‚Üí **Read and Write**
   - ` ` ‚Üí **Read and Write**
5. Set an expiration date (30‚Äì90 days is fine)
6. Click **Generate token**
7. **Copy the token** right away ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be able to see it again!

---

### üíª Step 3: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CMC-QCL/my_repo.git
cd my_repo
```

---

### üå± Step 4: Create a New Branch
```bash
git checkout -b your-name-branch
```

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Step 5: Edit the Story
Open `story.txt` and add **one sentence** to the story. Be creative, but don‚Äôt delete anyone else‚Äôs work.

---

### üíæ Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes
```bash
git add story.txt
git commit -m "Added a line by [Your Name]"
git push origin your-name-branch
```

> üí° When prompted for username/password:
> - Username: your GitHub username
> - Password: paste the **Personal Access Token** you just created

To avoid typing your token every time:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain  # For macOS
# or
git config --global credential.helper cache         # For temporary session caching
```

---

### üîÅ Step 7: Open a Pull Request
1. Go to the GitHub repo in your browser
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Write a short title and description
4. Submit your pull request

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional: Handling Merge Conflicts
If multiple people edit the same line, Git will show a conflict like:
```txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
This line was edited by Student A.
=======
This line was edited by Student B.
>>>>>>> your-branch
```
Manually choose which version to keep, then:
```bash
git add story.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

---

## üìú story.txt
Start of the story:
```txt
Once upon a time, there was a magical Git repository...
```
Everyone should add **one sentence** beneath this line.
